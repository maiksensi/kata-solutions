# FizzBuzz Refactoring Kata

https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/

Refactor this code so that adding the new feature is very easy. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change".

## New feature


In addition to Multiples of 3 being "Fizz" and multiples of 5 being "Buzz":

* Multiples of 7 are “Whizz”
* Multiples of 11 are “Bang”

That means for example that multiples of 3 & 7 are “FizzWhizz”, multiples of 5 & 11 are “BuzzBang” etc.
